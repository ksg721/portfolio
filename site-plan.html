        Hello, world!
        My name is Kyle Green and I am a software engineering major at BYU-Idaho. I created this website to help you get to know me better. I love to learn new things, develop new skills, and create. I also love sharing new things that I have learned and new things I have created with others, so here are a few projects I have worked on in Python!
        This projecct is a shopping list. This program allows for the user to creat a list and then eddit the contents of the list until they are finished.
        This project uses a file downloaded from OurWorldInData.Org that lists the life expectancy in different countried in different years. This program opens the CSV file and searches the opened file for the lowest and highest life expectancies and displays the data to the user.

      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>
        While my main focus is on software engineering, I have also taken an interest in web development. In addition to this site I have built one other website and I am excited to continue learning and growing my skills and knowledge in the field.
